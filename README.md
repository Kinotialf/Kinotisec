As an experienced professional in compliance, investigations, and risk management, I specialize in navigating complex security operations and ensuring adherence to regulatory frameworks. My career spans a diverse range of industries, including logistics, aviation, and international risk management. I bring a strategic approach to handling security, fraud, and counterfeit investigations, with a focus on maintaining procedural integrity, minimizing risks, and providing comprehensive compliance reviews.

## Objective
To leverage my expertise in compliance, threat assessment, crime mapping, and pattern analysis to develop secure, efficient environments that mitigate risks. By utilizing strategic crime mapping and pattern analysis, I aim to enhance organizational safety protocols and improve incident response. My focus includes evaluating building designs for security vulnerabilities, conducting detailed threat assessments, and implementing measures that safeguard assets while ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations.
